1. Modify the path in `pointlk`

# TODO



1. Finish gazebo state plot(delete rel localization)
2. Finish rel_state_plot


# Wheel odom reorganize

Odom published by gazebo controller : `robot0/odom -> robot0/base_footprint`
We want `robot0/odom -> robot1/odom`

The compute method is :
1. Get the initial position of robots
2. Compute them by `robot0/odom -> robot0/base_footprint` - `robot1/odom -> robot1/base_footprint` + `robot0/base_footprint -> robot1/base_footprint`

Initial topic : `robot0/wheel_odom`
Reorganized topic: `robot0/rel_wheel_odom`




## Troubleshooting
1. When try to modify the arg nmaeso of the gazebo diff driver failed. Use `odom` for default wheel odom.

## How to run now

1. Change path in `poinlk_reg.py` Line 9, `pointlk_reg.launch.py` Line 27
2. Launch simulation
```sh
ros2 launch turtle_bot_description multi_simulation_launch.py headless:=False
```
